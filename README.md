# Case: BTC PRICE PREDICTION
This data analysis case was developed as result of the class *ETL Fundamentals with Python*  from the bootcamp [CARREFOUR BANK DATA ENGINEER](https://web.digitalinnovation.one/track/banco-carrefour-data-engineer) from [Digital Innovation One](https://digitalinnovation.one).

# Description
In this project, BTC Price data from Quandl was queried to test its predictions for the dataset and for future data using LSTM Neural Network algorithm.

In order to run this Python code in your computer, install any version of Python 3 and pip install requirements.txt in your environment.

As this regression problem is non-convex, results vary according to the running environment. In this repository we present a example of graph obtained in one of these regressions (see priceHistory.png and 30dayPredict.png)
